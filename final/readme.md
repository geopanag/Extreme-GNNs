## Graph Neural Networks with Extreme Nodes Discrimination

Code to reproduce the analysis in the paper. The required folder structure is three empty folders : "data","results","figures" </br>
Each script is run independently, the egnn scripts are run first to produce the results. </br>
The planetoid datasets produce one result file each. The average_amazon_results.py is used to average the results from the experiments in the Amazon dataset.</br>
The script plot_node_edge_ratio.py is used to derive the number of nodes and edges for different extreme thresholds in the Amazon dataset. This dataset is used to plot Figure 10.
